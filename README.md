# Hospital Network Simulation

This project replicates a **multi-service hospital network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It demonstrates a realistic scenario of how modern hospitals connect multiple departments, servers, and IoT medical devices through a secure and segmented network.

> 🏫 **Note:** This project was developed as part of the *Computer Networks* course (**UE23CS252B**) at **PES University**.

## 🏥 **Project Overview**

- Designed a hospital network topology with core switches, access switches, end devices, servers, and IoT nodes.
- Simulated real-world services like web access, file sharing, and IoT monitoring.
- Verified packet transfers, IP addressing, and basic VLAN segmentation.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

1. **End-to-End Packet Transfer:** Connectivity between multiple departments and client machines.
2. **HTTP Servers:** Enable web access for internal applications.
3. **File Servers:** Centralized storage for patient reports and medical data.
4. **IoT Servers:** Connect IoT-enabled medical devices for remote monitoring.
